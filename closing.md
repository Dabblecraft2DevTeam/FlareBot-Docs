# All good things come to an end
Thanks for coming along for the ride!

FlareBot was always a great project, it has been very fun for the past year and a half. It has brought so much crap as well though. There's been a lot of stuff that's happened on the surface and behind the scenes, it's caused a lot of stress and over time has just built up to more than I care for. Flare has been slowing in growth, I haven't wanted to work on it and just wanted to not even look at this guild.

The time has come I believe for me to move on. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression years ago and I still suffer from both heavily to this day despite seeing multiple professionals about them. Flare and this guild really has not helped, not to mention in the last month I broke up with someone (most of you know who but please, let us have our privacy) and just having to deal with stress outside of here too. 

What's next for me? No idea, I will probably be deleting my Discord and just moving on. I've met many great people here and I have ways to communicate with them but I've also had a lot of people who hate me, I've blocked and people who hate because they can. It will be good to get away from those people.

FlareBot will be up till the end of the month and that will be it, music commands will stop functioning as of today.
Everything has an end, for me it's FlareBot and just Discord in general.
