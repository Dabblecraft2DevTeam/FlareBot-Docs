# 4.2 the cleanup update
## Changes
  - Lots of back-end work (more info below)
  - Permissions
    - The default group no longer exists.
      - Users have the default perms without needing the "Default" group.
    - Negative perms can now be used to remove permissions from a user.
    - Group hierarchy has been implemented meaning groups higher will override groups below them.
  - Buttons!
    - `_song` and `_skip` have buttons now. More to come in the future
    - Pages now have buttons for easy navigation.
  - Pages
    - Most pages should now be smaller and a bit bettee fitting. Most will also have buttons!
  - Nino
	  - It's an anti invite system for your server. You can find everything you need for nino in the `_nino` command
  - Jumbo
	  - Ever wanted bigger emotes? Now you can with the jumbo command.
	  - Supports up the 5 emotes at once, and gives info on emotes
	  - Note: Only works on custom emotes
  - Settings
	  - Guild settings are now a thing!
	  - Settings allows you to blacklist channels and various other things you might want to change about the bot.
